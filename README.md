# 🌾 AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian Agriculture through Data

---

## 📘 Project Overview

**AgriData Explorer** is a data-driven project that focuses on understanding Indian agricultural trends using **Python (EDA & SQL)** and **Power BI**.  
The project provides insights into **crop production, yield, and area** across different Indian states, helping users and policymakers make **data-backed decisions**.

## 🧩 Project Components

The project includes three main parts:

### 📂 Dataset Folder (`data/`)
- Contains the agricultural dataset used for analysis.  
  **Example file:** `agriculture_data.csv`

### 📓 Notebook Folder (`notebook/`)
- Includes the Python analysis files with complete **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, **data cleaning**, and **SQL queries**.  
  **File:** `AgriData_Explorer.py`

### 📊 Power BI Folder (`powerbi/`)
- Contains screenshots of the Power BI Dashboard showcasing **EDA and SQL-based insights visually**.  
  **Example files:**
  - `EDA_Dashboard.png`
  - `SQL_Insights_Dashboard.png`

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore agricultural data and identify production patterns  
- Analyze relationships between **area, yield, and production**  
- Create **visual dashboards** for better understanding and decision-making  
- Answer analytical questions using **SQL queries** and visualize them in Power BI
